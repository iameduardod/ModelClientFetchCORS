# ModelClientFetchCORS

By using extending/updating Adobe's aem-spa-page-model-manager Model Client https://github.com/adobe/aem-spa-page-model-manager/tree/master/src, you can enable an architecture where SPAs are developed indepdent and outside of AEM, but still have them authored inside AEM via external HTTP calls. This requires Basis Authenticated enabled on your AEM instance along with CORS enabled from AEM.
